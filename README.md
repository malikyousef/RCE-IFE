<p align="justify">Recursive Cluster Elimination with Intra-Cluster Feature Elimination (RCE-IFE) can be considered as an extension of Support Vector Machine - Rcecurtsive Cluster Elimination (SVM-RCE) approach. RCE-IFE differs from SVM-RCE in that it includes both cluster elimination and feature removal. Also, RF is used instead of SVM. Cluster elimination followed by intra-cluster elimination contributes to further reduction in feature subset size, improvement in model performance and decrease in execution time.</p>
